grasp
=====

A C++ [YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp) set of libraries and modules that provides the **iCub** robot with grasping capabilities.

## Installation

##### Dependencies
- [YARP](https://github.com/robotology/yarp)
- [iCub](https://github.com/robotology/icub-main)
- [icub-contrib-common](https://github.com/robotology/icub-contrib-common)
- [stereo-vision](https://github.com/robotology/stereo-vision)
- [segmentation](https://github.com/robotology/segmentation)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
- [PCL: Point Cloud Library] (http://pointclouds.org/)

#### Notes on Point Cloud Library
PCL also relies on a number of dependencies. Most of them can be installed with the classic `sudo apt-get install` command. You are going to need:

- **boost** >= 1.4.6
- **eigen** >= 3.0
- **flann** >= 1.7.1
- **vtk** >= 5.6
- **qhull** 2009

We recommend to install **boost** and **eigen** from `sudo-apt get install`, whereas **flann** and **vtk** can be installed easily either from sources or `sudo apt-get install`. The dependency **qhull** needs definitely to be installed from sources, as there is a problem between newer version of **qhull** and **pcl** >= 1.7.0, at least on Debian systems. For those who have Windows, it is usually enough to install the dependencies using binaries. Once you have all the dependencies, you can download the source code of **pcl** `1.7.0` (or **pcl** `1.7.1`), compile it and install it.
